# OCR_project
Optical Character Recognition(OCR) is used to detect text from images, in this project we have tried to built an ocr which will detect both mathematical expressions as well as alphabetical text. For mathematical expressions we used LatexOCR and for alphabetical text, Pytesseract is used.
